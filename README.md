# Loan-App
 the main objective for this project is to predict the best way to get a loan from lending club and making a machine learning model to predict the possibility to get the loan for every person.
Lending Club, as an online banking platform, is becoming increasingly popular ever since it started in 2007. By applying machine learning techniques, we intend to investigate following questions:
Using supervised methods, can one predict if a loan application would be approved?
Given that an application is approved, can we correctly predict the offered interest rate?
Has the standard of Lending Club approvals changed over the years of 2007-2015, especially after their initial public offering?
Can we extract a trend of how the significance of various features has changed over the years? 
Can this information be used to game their online system to increase applicationsâ€™ chance of approval?
Can we find some structure among this rich dataset which can be used to generate artificial data for our models, especially for the earlier years of Lending Club?
